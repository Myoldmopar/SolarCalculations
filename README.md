# SolarCalculations
This is a collection of solar angle and related calculations.

## Source
These are based mostly on Chapter 6 of _Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning_ by Faye McQuistion and Jerald Parker, 3rd Edition, 1988.  Other sources are noted in the source.  All the functions were written from scratch by me.

## Documentation
Documentation is hosted on [ReadTheDocs](http://solar-calculations.readthedocs.org/en/latest/): ![](https://readthedocs.org/projects/solar-calculations/badge/?version=latest)
The functions are all documented with Markdown syntax doc strings in a way that Sphinx can interpret them.  The documentation is hosted on [this repo's gh-page](http://myoldmopar.github.io/SolarCalculations/). To build the documentation, enter the docs/ subdirectory and execute `make html`; then open `/docs/_build/html/index.html` to see the documentation.

## Testing
The source is tested using the python unittest framework.  To execute all the unit tests, just execute the test file (since it calls `unittest.main()`): `python test/test_solar.py`.  I still have several more unit tests to add.

## Validation
The code has been carefully compared against numerous sampled points in the unit tests, and also [against EnergyPlus output](https://github.com/Myoldmopar/SolarCalculations/wiki/CompareToEnergyPlus), to ensure accurate values are being calculated.  If you find something wrong, just [file an issue](https://github.com/Myoldmopar/SolarCalculations/issues/new)!

## Demonstration
In order to show how to use the library, a [demonstration page](https://github.com/Myoldmopar/SolarCalculations/wiki/DemoSolarAngles) was created, that is based on the source in the demos/ folder.
